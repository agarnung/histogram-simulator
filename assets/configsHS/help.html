    <h2>Help on Using the Simulator</h2>
    <p>Below are instructions and recommendations for correctly using the 'Histogram Simulator' application.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h2><span style='color:#00D000;'>Introduction:</span></h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The purpose of the simulator is to manually create a 'transfer function' that maps input gray levels to output gray levels and apply it (e.g.) to transform the input image's intensity histogram in some way, whether to enhance contrast, increase or decrease brightness, or perform any desired affine intensity transformation. There are two ways to modify the LUT ('look-up table') applied to the input image in real-time: by drawing the curve through control points (each press of 'CREATE LUT WITH CONTROL POINTS' updates the LUT with the control points) or, for finer adjustments, manually value by value, currently restricted to the range 0-255 (CV_8U) (using the ComboBox to select the input value [x] to modify and the LineEdit and adjacent button to enter the corresponding output value [y]). In the central histogram, there is a diagonal reference line representing the 'unity transformation,' which can help when plotting a curve.

            <h2><span style='color:#00D000;'>Typical Usage Procedure:</span></h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Load the image with the 'LOAD IMAGE' button (any standar format is supported, although the simulator converts it to CV_8U if it's not in this format).
                </li>
                <li>
                    By default, there is one control point (gray) that cannot be removed but can be moved; this is due to the nature of BÃ©zier curves that create the transfer function. The same applies to the two black points (fixed) on either side; from x = 0 to the leftmost point, all 'x' values map to the ordinate of that point, while from the fixed point's 'x' value on the left to x = 255, all values map to the ordinate of the rightmost point. These fixed points can be moved freely in space with the sliders, but the left point cannot currently surpass the right point along the x-axis.
                </li>
                <li>
                    On the left, the input image and its histogram are displayed, while the transformed output would appear on the right. In the middle, the original reference histogram is displayed in the background, along with the curve drawn in real time. Points can be moved at will and new points added with the 'ADD CONTROL POINT' button. Points have tooltips showing their index. A new control point will be added slightly to the right of the current rightmost control point.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Pressing 'TRANSFORM' applies the last curve updated with 'CREATE LUT WITH CONTROL POINTS' and generates the output image. At that moment, the LUT composed at that point (whether immediately after a fine adjustment or after updating the curve) is applied to the input image. Pressing 'SAVE LUT' writes a JSON encapsulating the LUT into the specified directory; later one could load it again through the simulator. Pressing 'SAVE CURVE' saves a JSON containing (only) all current control points to a directory for later export and import. 'LOAD IMAGE' allows starting over with a new image from scratch. 'SAVE IMAGES TO...' saves the input and output as PNGs in a directory with a default name. 'LOAD CURVE' imports a previously saved JSON with control points, if available.

        </li>

            <h2><span style='color:#F00000;'>Warnings:</span></h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Applying an incorrect LUT. <strong><span style='color:#00D000;'>Tip:</span></strong> If you decide to make a fine adjustment to the LUT by individually modifying the 'x' values, it's recommended to check the logs or output JSON to ensure the saved LUT is correct.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>The transfer function is not applied or mapped correctly. <strong><span style='color:#00D000;'>Tip:</span></strong> Ensure the curve is consistent; it is recommended that it be monotonically increasing or decreasing unless special transformations are required.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>A control point is not visible in the scene. <strong><span style='color:#00D000;'>Tip:</span></strong> Avoid moving control points beyond the visible area of the QGraphicsView; for this case, fine-tune the LUT using the LineEdit. It's also recommended not to skimp on the number of control points added.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>My curve or LUT being adjusted has been lost. <strong><span style='color:#00D000;'>Tip:</span></strong> As soon as 'CREATE LUT WITH CONTROL POINTS' is pressed, the LUT is updated, so be cautious if you want to make fine adjustments without overwriting it. It is recommended to save the curve or LUT frequently to avoid losing them.</li>
            </ul>
