# histogram-simulator
An application to perform LUT-based image histogram modification interactively

This project uses [OpenCV 4](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/4.10.0) (see additional packages in https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/d7/d9f/tutorial_linux_install.html)

_TODO_:
The idea will be binding all required libraries to a ingle AppImage, in order to ship the application directly
